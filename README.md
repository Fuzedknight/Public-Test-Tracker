# Public-Test-Tracker
Bug tracker for the test server

Found some bugs and wanna help out? great! Just a few things to make sure the channel is clean.

Make sure to describe as much as possible including mob names and areas.

DO NOT have arguments about how certain things should be fixed in this tracker, do it on discord.

Make sure you research what you are claiming before making the report as false positives can occur often.

Try to include the IDs of items/spells/monsters you are referring to, these are usually the numbers at the end of a URL in classicDB. This helps me a lot in tracking down what's happening in the database.

When fixing your bug I respond to your post or @you on discord if I need more information.

If you are not sure you have found a bug or just wanna give an opinion on something such as drop rates of the AI of a monster just drop me a PM and I can look into it for ya. (assuming you guys don't spam me)
